				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo is home to the Pokemon franchise and their upcoming games will be available on the Nintendo 3DS portable game console.</p>
<p>The new Pokemon games are called “Sun and Moon” and much like its predecessors, both of them have the same plot but with different Pokemon and enemies.</p>
<p>The game will be released soon so in this article, I will talk about the 4 things you need to know about the upcoming Pokemon Sun and Moon games:</p>
<p>1. Starting Pokemon: If you’ve played Pokemon games before, you know that when you start out, you will be able to choose your starting Pokemon. That trend continues with the Pokemon Sun and Moon and the starting Pokemon you can choose from are Litten, Popplio, and Rowlet. These Pokemon represent three different elements: Fire, Grass, and Water. It doesn’t matter which Pokemon you will choose first as they will be good enough as a starting Pokemon.</p>
<p>2. You Can Ride a Pokemon. This feature was introduced back in the Pokemon X and Y. Basically, there are some particular Pokemon that you can ride, although not all Pokemon can be ridden. This is a perfect way to bond with your Pokemon and it would be a fantastic experience once you ride one of your Pokemon and traverse through the city.</p>
<p>3. New Pokemon. Just like every iteration of Pokemon games, there are always going to be some new Pokemon to choose. Although it hasn’t been fully disclosed, Nintendo teased the fans and they’ve showcased some of the confirmed new Pokemon that will be available in the game. Some of the new Pokemon are, Drampa, Cutiefly, Charjabug, Tapu Koko, Togedemaru, and Bruxish, and Vikavolt. Unfortunately, there still aren’t any pictures of the new Pokemon online. So I guess we will have to wait until the game comes out to see them all.</p>
<p>4. Different Gameplay Elements. Much like Pokemon games of old, the Pokemon Sun and Moon will have the same plot. But, there will be some major differences in the game. The different versions will have a different set of Pokemon and that the trainers that you will face will also have a slight variation as to what Pokemon they will use. Furthermore, there will be a few different Pokemon that will be available in the sun version and there will also be a few different Pokemon that will be available on the Moon version as well.</p>
<p>So, the question now is, when will the Pokemon Sun and Moon be released? I am glad you asked because the Pokemon Sun and Moon will be released November 23, 2016.</p>
<p>There is also news that whenever you pre-order the game, you will also receive limited edition Pokemon merchandise for free.</p>
<p>Fans of the Pokemon franchise would be happy as the new Pokemon Sun and Moon games are available for the Nintendo 3DS portable game console.</p>
<p>So Pokemon fans, mark your calendars and save the date, November 23, 2016!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mobile phone signal boosters are effective little objects that improve your phone’s mobile phone signal reception by getting weak outside signals and rebroadcasting it in your home or vehicle.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though people are experiencing problems with their mobile phone’s signal reception, they still do not want to get a mobile phone signal booster.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Why is that? The reason why people do not get mobile phone signal boosters is mainly because of the price.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You see, mobile phone signal boosters nowadays, albeit effective, are also very expensive. People just want a simple and inexpensive solution to solve their problems with low signal reception.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">I get it, some mobile phone signal boosters do come with a heavy price tag, but not all of them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this article, we are going to talk about a mobile phone signal booster that is not only inexpensive but it can truly boost mobile phone signals without having to dish out a lot of money.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Phonetone 1800 3G Mobile Phone Signal Booster is a signal booster that does just that. To know more about the product, let’s take a look at its features:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Small Size, Light Weight, Beautiful Repeater</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Low Operating Temperature</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">High-Gain Linear Power</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Ultra-Low Noise Receiver</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Full-Duplex Communication Mode</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Single Band 1800MHz 65dB</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Worked with 1800MHz network</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">CE Certificated</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Phonetone 1800 3G Mobile Phone Signal Booster got its name because it is a signal booster that only operates on the 1800MHz frequency and it also boosts only 3G mobile phone signals.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If your mobile phone service provider does not support the 1800MHz frequency, then you may want to get another mobile phone signal booster that supports it.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Phonetone 1800 3G Mobile Phone Signal Booster comes with an efficient 65 dB signal amplifier that is more than adequate to boost mobile phone signals in your home and small office.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It provides a 5000 sq ft. coverage area which is quite respectable, and it should cover a large land mass.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">With all of that being said, here is the complete installation process for this mobile phone signal booster:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Go to the highest point of your house and mount the external antenna. No need to angle the antenna since the Phonetone 1800 comes with an omnidirectional antenna.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the Phonetone 1800 3G Mobile Phone Signal Booster sports a mount design, you can just mount the actual signal amplifier somewhere convenient, preferably near a window.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Place the internal antenna in the middle portion of your house for maximum coverage.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Plug the included power adapter into your home’s power supply and plug it in the signal booster.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Plug all of the cables into their respective ports and power on the device.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The signal booster doesn’t have any notification LEDs or what have you; you will just know that it is now working when you’re experiencing better signal reception.</span></span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As previously mentioned, not all mobile phone signal boosters come with a steep price tag. The Phonetone 1800 3G Mobile Phone Signal Booster only costs $210 and it does the job of boosting 3G mobile phone signals pretty well.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Infinity Blade 3 is the latest entry from CHAIR entertainment and the sequel to its popular predecessor, Infinity Blade 2.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This game has been highly regarded by gaming pundits as one of the best games in the Apple app store to date. And rightfully so, this game has been downloaded more than 15 million times in the App store. That is just a testament to how great this game is.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">For those of you who are not familiar with this gaming franchise, the Infinity Blade 3 for iOS mobile phones is an action-adventure game that makes use of the intuitive touch and swipe gestures of your Apple mobile phone.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, what features are different in the Infinity Blade 3 for iOS mobile phones? Actually, there are many things that are different and we will go over them in this article.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The story revolves around the Knight Siris and his companion, Isa, as they joined ranks with the God-King Raidriar. Together, they will attempt to free the land from captivity from the Worker of Secrets and their vast army of undead minions.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The mission is noble and it is also very hard as well. Your ultimate goal is to unlock the true powers of the Infinity blade to help you battle these nefarious creatures. As the game developers put it, the game is about a “…timeless adventure of champions and villains.”</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As mentioned earlier, the Infinity Blade 3 for iOS makes use of the iPhone’s touch controls. You can pretty much do everything with the touch controls from blocking attacks, dodging incoming projectiles, casting magical spells, and simply hacking and slashing the enemies. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are certain touch and swipe gestures you can do to perform a particular task. Fortunately, you can set these swipe gestures according to your preference.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The game also sports an easy navigation scheme. All you have to do to really explore the game is just tap the area of the screen and Siris will go to that specific location. You can do this and you can uncover a lot of mysteries the game’s world has to offer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If there is one huge thing that has changed from the previous Infinity Blade games, it is most probably the environment. The Infinity Blade 3 for iOS mobile phones now has a massive and immersive gameplay environment.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Players can marvel at the scenery, beautiful landscapes, and a game full of storyline and side quests. There will never be a dull moment when playing this game.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In previous Infinity Blade games, you can only control the Knight Siris. But in this game, you can now control Siris’ thief companion, Isa. Both of them have three different unique combat styles and it is up to you to choose which one suits your playstyle the most.</span></span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">What I love about the Infinity Blade 3 for iOS is that you can connect online and you can join other players in the quest to find loot and other treasures hidden across the land. You can team up with other players up to a maximum of 5 members in a party for a really fun experience.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since this game uses mobile internet connection, be sure to get the help of mobile phone signal boosters so that you will not lag in-game.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Infinity Blade 3 for iOS costs $7 and is available in the Apple App store.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Motorola has been on the forefront of creating a lot of great mobile phones at an inexpensive price point. They’ve released their own flagship model, the Moto X, in 2015 but they are still not satisfied with just one flagship model.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, what did they do? They went on and created three flagship models that carry the Moto X moniker.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this article, we are going to talk about the Moto X Play Android Mobile Phone. This phone is designed for people who are more adventurous and are almost always on the go. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Let’s start talking about the design of the mobile phone first. The Moto X Play is a standard mobile phone in that it doesn’t have any eye-catching design from an aesthetics standpoint.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It has an arched back that allows you to grip the mobile phone without any problems. In fact, it has a 10.9mm thickness, which by today’s standards, is a little bit on the chunky side. But, it is not that chunky that you wouldn’t want to hold it for a long time.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the sides of the mobile phone is a metallic rim which gives it a little bit of a premium look. On the top side lies the 3.5mm jack that sits perfectly in the middle of the phone. Just beside the headphone jack lies the microSD card and the SIM card slots which are an ideal place to put them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The display of the Moto X Play Android mobile phone is quite good. It has a 5.5-inch TFT LCD screen with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 and a pixel density of 403ppi. Streaming content on this mobile phone is a sure treat as you will be treated with fantastic visuals. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This mobile phone is catered for people who are always on the go. That also means that the Moto X Play is a phone that has a water-resistant coating. Now, don’t go submerging your phone in the water as it just offers a slight water-repellent action and it doesn’t really protect your phone if you submerge it.</span></span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As for the operating system, the Moto X Play Android mobile phone comes with a vanilla version of Android Lollipop 5.1.1. What I mean by the Vanilla version is that the operating system does not come with pre-installed bloatware as opposed to other mobile phone manufacturers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since people who are always on the go do not have time to wait for things, the Moto X Play will not disappoint from a performance standpoint. This mobile phone is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor and it also has the Adreno 405 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The camera of the Moto X Play is really good. It comes with a 21-megapixel snapper with HDR feature turned on by default. It is capable of recording 4K resolution videos (but that option should be turned on in the settings menu).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And lastly, this wouldn’t be a mobile phone for people one the go without a hefty battery, right? The Moto X play comes with a 3,640 MaH battery with fast-charging capabilities. The battery is quite beefy with a lot of juice to go around with but you have to buy the fast charger as it is sold separately.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Moto X Play Android mobile phone does not disappoint. And with a price of only $350, this is really a solid mobile phone option for people on the go.</span></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Routers are rapidly evolving, taking on new technologies and giving it to customers. These new routers are not cheap, and rightfully so, they are the routers for the next generation. But, what if you just want a simple and inexpensive solution? What if you just want a trusty router? </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, look no further, because we are going to take a look at the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router. D-Link is one of the most trusted Router manufacturers in the world. They specialize in routers such as home routers, and they’ve even created routers that are suited for gamers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But, today, we’re going to take a closer inspection on one of their budget offerings. The D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router is a dual-band router that has 3 external antennas for improved range. In fact, the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router is touted to be one of the most powerful routers at the budget price range because of its WiFI Range.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Before we discuss the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router even further, let’s take a look at its features:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Next Generation Wireless Technology</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Wireless AC750 for optimized performance and reliable coverage delivering smooth HD video streaming, fast file transfers and lag-free video chatting.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Dual Band Performance</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 433Mbps (5GHz) to deliver fast wireless speeds and less interference for maximum throughput</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wired Connectivity</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Four Fast Ethernet ports for fast device connectivity.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>High-Performance Antennas</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: 3 high-performance antennas deliver maximum range around your home.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The DIR-813 uses a smart WiFi technology because it can separate gaming and multimedia streams for uninterrupted play. Really old routers do not have this technology, and games and multimedia are shared in one stream. This results into laggy gameplay and stuttering when streaming videos.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But, with the D-Link DIR-813, that is non-existent. Gaming streams will be put on the 2.4GHz band, while streaming and other multimedia services will be put on a much faster 5GHz band.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Moreover, the DIR-813 boats of an impressive range. According to their website, the WiFi signals can penetrate even thick walls. Enjoy gaming and streaming anywhere on your home and office, that is the promise of the DIR-813.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Also, the DIR-813 uses the “Fast Ethernet” technology, where it boasts of speeds of up to 10x faster than the conventional Ethernet port. This means that you will get impressive speeds whatever you do online, such as gaming or streaming media content.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, how does the D-Link DIR-813 fair to customers?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Alex</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve used D-Link routers for many, many years now in my home and office. My cousin wanted to get my old D-Link Router which I had for 5 years, and I am on the lookout for a new D-Link router. I came across the DIR-813 and I am very impressed with its features and price. I bought it and I never regret my purchase! I didn&#8217;t need a range extender anymore as this router is giving out good signals anywhere on my house!&#8221;</i></span></span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Randy</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&#8220;For the price, nothing compares to this router. This is a dual-band router and it comes with 3 external antennas. For a budget price, 3 external antennas are unheard of! Luckily, I found this router and I went on to buy it. I and my wife love the coverage and the features of this router. This is definitely highly recommended!&#8221;</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it is just a budget router, the D-Link DIR-813 boasts of impressive features that are only usually found on high-end routers. The D-Link DIR-813 is priced at $29.</span></span></p>
