				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Routers are rapidly evolving, taking on new technologies and giving it to customers. These new routers are not cheap, and rightfully so, they are the routers for the next generation. But, what if you just want a simple and inexpensive solution? What if you just want a trusty router? </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, look no further, because we are going to take a look at the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router. D-Link is one of the most trusted Router manufacturers in the world. They specialize in routers such as home routers, and they’ve even created routers that are suited for gamers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But, today, we’re going to take a closer inspection on one of their budget offerings. The D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router is a dual-band router that has 3 external antennas for improved range. In fact, the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router is touted to be one of the most powerful routers at the budget price range because of its WiFI Range.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Before we discuss the D-Link DIR-813 AC750 Wi-Fi Router even further, let’s take a look at its features:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Next Generation Wireless Technology</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Wireless AC750 for optimized performance and reliable coverage delivering smooth HD video streaming, fast file transfers and lag-free video chatting.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Dual Band Performance</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Up to 300Mbps (2.4GHz) + 433Mbps (5GHz) to deliver fast wireless speeds and less interference for maximum throughput</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Wired Connectivity</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> &#8211; Four Fast Ethernet ports for fast device connectivity.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>High-Performance Antennas</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: 3 high-performance antennas deliver maximum range around your home.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The DIR-813 uses a smart WiFi technology because it can separate gaming and multimedia streams for uninterrupted play. Really old routers do not have this technology, and games and multimedia are shared in one stream. This results into laggy gameplay and stuttering when streaming videos.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">But, with the D-Link DIR-813, that is non-existent. Gaming streams will be put on the 2.4GHz band, while streaming and other multimedia services will be put on a much faster 5GHz band.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Moreover, the DIR-813 boats of an impressive range. According to their website, the WiFi signals can penetrate even thick walls. Enjoy gaming and streaming anywhere on your home and office, that is the promise of the DIR-813.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Also, the DIR-813 uses the “Fast Ethernet” technology, where it boasts of speeds of up to 10x faster than the conventional Ethernet port. This means that you will get impressive speeds whatever you do online, such as gaming or streaming media content.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, how does the D-Link DIR-813 fair to customers?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Alex</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&#8220;I&#8217;ve used D-Link routers for many, many years now in my home and office. My cousin wanted to get my old D-Link Router which I had for 5 years, and I am on the lookout for a new D-Link router. I came across the DIR-813 and I am very impressed with its features and price. I bought it and I never regret my purchase! I didn&#8217;t need a range extender anymore as this router is giving out good signals anywhere on my house!&#8221;</i></span></span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Randy</b></span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">: </span></span><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><i>&#8220;For the price, nothing compares to this router. This is a dual-band router and it comes with 3 external antennas. For a budget price, 3 external antennas are unheard of! Luckily, I found this router and I went on to buy it. I and my wife love the coverage and the features of this router. This is definitely highly recommended!&#8221;</i></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it is just a budget router, the D-Link DIR-813 boasts of impressive features that are only usually found on high-end routers. The D-Link DIR-813 is priced at $29.</span></span></p>
