				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b></b><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Motorola has been on the forefront of creating a lot of great mobile phones at an inexpensive price point. They’ve released their own flagship model, the Moto X, in 2015 but they are still not satisfied with just one flagship model.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, what did they do? They went on and created three flagship models that carry the Moto X moniker.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In this article, we are going to talk about the Moto X Play Android Mobile Phone. This phone is designed for people who are more adventurous and are almost always on the go. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Let’s start talking about the design of the mobile phone first. The Moto X Play is a standard mobile phone in that it doesn’t have any eye-catching design from an aesthetics standpoint.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It has an arched back that allows you to grip the mobile phone without any problems. In fact, it has a 10.9mm thickness, which by today’s standards, is a little bit on the chunky side. But, it is not that chunky that you wouldn’t want to hold it for a long time.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">On the sides of the mobile phone is a metallic rim which gives it a little bit of a premium look. On the top side lies the 3.5mm jack that sits perfectly in the middle of the phone. Just beside the headphone jack lies the microSD card and the SIM card slots which are an ideal place to put them.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The display of the Moto X Play Android mobile phone is quite good. It has a 5.5-inch TFT LCD screen with a resolution of 1920&#215;1080 and a pixel density of 403ppi. Streaming content on this mobile phone is a sure treat as you will be treated with fantastic visuals. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This mobile phone is catered for people who are always on the go. That also means that the Moto X Play is a phone that has a water-resistant coating. Now, don’t go submerging your phone in the water as it just offers a slight water-repellent action and it doesn’t really protect your phone if you submerge it.</span></span></p>
<p><a name="_GoBack"></a><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As for the operating system, the Moto X Play Android mobile phone comes with a vanilla version of Android Lollipop 5.1.1. What I mean by the Vanilla version is that the operating system does not come with pre-installed bloatware as opposed to other mobile phone manufacturers.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since people who are always on the go do not have time to wait for things, the Moto X Play will not disappoint from a performance standpoint. This mobile phone is equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 Octa-core processor and it also has the Adreno 405 GPU and 2GB of RAM.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The camera of the Moto X Play is really good. It comes with a 21-megapixel snapper with HDR feature turned on by default. It is capable of recording 4K resolution videos (but that option should be turned on in the settings menu).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And lastly, this wouldn’t be a mobile phone for people one the go without a hefty battery, right? The Moto X play comes with a 3,640 MaH battery with fast-charging capabilities. The battery is quite beefy with a lot of juice to go around with but you have to buy the fast charger as it is sold separately.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Tahoma, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The Moto X Play Android mobile phone does not disappoint. And with a price of only $350, this is really a solid mobile phone option for people on the go.</span></span></p>
